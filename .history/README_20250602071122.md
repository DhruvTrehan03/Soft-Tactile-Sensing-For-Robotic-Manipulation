## Summary of Weekly Logs (Git Commits also give reference if necessary)
### Michaelmas
 
- Week 1-3: 
  - Literature Review
  - Designed Clamp for PCB and Fingertip
  - Soldered EIT Board
  - Designed mould for hydrogel fingertip
  - Clamped hydrogel to board and tested
  - Images and Video (can be found in Presentations\Dhruv Update)
  - Set-up basic simulated FEM with a point force
- Week 4: 
  - Simulated Signals Generated for a point press
  - Code for reading EIT data finished
  - Created screwdriver setup and tested with load cell
  - Simultaneous EIT sensors and Load Data code written
  - Issues with serial Commmunication
- Week 5: 
  - Fixed Issues with serial communication
  - 2 Sensors added to Parallel Gripper 
  - Clamped gripper to table and clamped screwdriver upside down, twisted load cell to create a toprque and measured on EIT as proof of concept
  - Michaelmas Presentation Draft 
- Week 6:
  - Recieved UR5
  - Learnt how to program UR5 
  - Setup code to interface with UR5 (finicky and took the whole week)
- Week 7: 
  - Created code to automate UR5 twisting for torque measurement. 
  - Tested code, ensured safe operation
- Week 8: 
  - Ran code (end of michaelmas) to get results
  - Collected dataset of 100 Torque Values

- Michaelmas Holiday
  - Holiday spent analysing the code 
  - Tested many different methods of comparing channels to gorund truth, correlation, absolute correlation, fft, dtw
  - Settled on correlation after manually checking top few rankings using all methods
  - Ranked signals
  - Calculated 'Error Improvement' to find how error changes as you use more channels (linear regression) to calculate the torque
  - Found 'Improvement' points: 70/80/90% Improvement points can be found (169,272,475 channels respectively)
  - Top ranked channels plotted using vectors on a diagram
  - Analysed this diagram in nany ways, observing a pattern 
  - Pattern used to propose a model of torque-conductivity 
  - Simulated model

### Lent
- Week 1: 
  - Fine tuned simulation, discovered simulation not accurate enough to directly predict signal but shape can be used
  - Tried to use EIDORS inverse problem on data, found it was noisy not very useable
- Week 2: 
  - Research into material/mechanical properties
  - Deep dive into lots of equations from mathematical papers/materials papers
- Week 3: 
  - The complex models were difficult to work with
  - Stepped back and proposed 5 simple models
  - Based of complex models and physical basis
- Week 4: 
  - Using simple models generate FEM for simulated models
  - Diameter investigation started and cylinders 3D printed
  - Generated Signals for simulated models
- Week 5: 
  - Difficult to compare generated signal to real signal, whole week spent devising a robust methodology, settled on use of envelope of signal.
- Week 6: 
  - Compared models, decided on a best model
  - Began Diameter testing
  - Programmed UR5 and tested for safety
- Week 7:
  - Used simulated signals to compare the the different torques trying to fit the best paramters for the model for each data set
  - Data was very noisy, not perfect
- Week 8: 
  - Readings for Diameter taken
  - Best fit for torque data still not ideal
  - Finished term and all experiments

- Lent Holiday
  - Tried to keep finiding fit for paramters with diamter and torque data now
  - Tried doing this over both parameters rather than 1 at a time
  - Still an issue, decided to go back and reconsider how the data is processed
  - Fixed data processing (denoising fixed)
  - Results start to look promising but take a while to get
  - Precompute a signal bank of the  model simulated data
  - Found promising results
  - Increased resolution to get better idea of results
  - Great results, analyse everything write up paper/ final report, take final photos (wrap everything up)!
